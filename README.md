## Introduction

Welcome to S-Din! This is the most powerful *S*earch engine and *D*esign platform for *i*nspiration with *n*etwork analysis in Synthetic Biology ever. 

S-Din (/sdÉªn/, *verb*) your keyword to:

- Search for projects, parts and papers in Synthetic biology

- Get inspired from infomations provided by our software. Don't worry, [our powerful algorithms](http://2017.igem.org/Team:SYSU-Software/Model) will provide you the best infomations, rapidly and accurately.

- Design your circuits. With our design tool, you are enabled to integrate collected circuits and parts. Don't know what to add? Recommendation based on interaction prediction may give you a hand.

- Finished your design? Simulate it in a single click! After simulation, plasmid generator may help in lab validation.

SynBio is just a S-Din away! 

## Requirements

S-Din requires a web browser and a single click: [http://sdin.sysusoftware.info](http://sdin.sysusoftware.info). S-Din it right now!

To setup a server, follow this:

## Installation

### Before installation

To install S-Din, firstly, you should make sure the following requirements are satisfied:

* `Python` >= 3.5 : 

    Run `python3 --version` in a command line to check it.

* `MySQL` >= 5.7 :

    Installation differs from different operating systems. Follow your OS's official guide or [MySQL official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) to install it. Run `mysql --version` to check installation.
    
    Also make sure that character sets are set to UTF-8. You can follow [our guide](https://github.com/StrickerLee/SYSU-Software-2017/wiki/Set-MySQL's-character-set-to-UTF-8) to set it.

### Installation

* **Clone**

  Clone the repository like `git clone https://github.com/igemsoftware2017/SYSU-Software-2017`

* **Setting MySQL root account**

  To set up MySQL users used by S-Din, we need your MySQL root account. Add `SYSU-Software-2017/tools/config.json` like:

  ~~~json
  {	
      "mysql_root_account": "root", 
      "mysql_root_password": "123456"
  }
  ~~~

* **Install**

    The main installation process is packed into scripts. Run `setup.sh` (`Setup.bat` for Windows) for installation. Since the powerful S-Din have enormous data, it may take several minutes to initialize the database. After a cup of coffee, just simply `runserver.sh` (`runserver.bat` for Windows) to launch the server. So easy!
